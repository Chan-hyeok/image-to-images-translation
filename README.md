image to images translation - Multi task pix2pix

This repository contains the codes and example images/folders for image-to-images translation. <br>
image-to-images translation is the extended version of image-to-image translation (pix2pix) which can learn and provide two out images. <br>

The codes are based on codes of pix2pix shared by https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow and is modified to address our desired goals.

This concept and code is used in the following research:<br>
